//Leetcode Hard Problem no 1095
//https://leetcode.com/problems/find-in-mountain-array/description/
// The approach used here is totally correct but in the question we can't access the array like arr[i] we have to use the api
// so we have to use MountainArray.get(index) instead of arr[index] and MountainArray.length() instead of arr.length
